<p class="cnNlNGI0YjUzYzc0YjRlNTE5NDE1NWZiOTIyMGUxNjg5" style="margin-bottom: 0">Rain scrunched up his eyes and tried to worm his way deeper into the covers. It was way too early to get up in his book. He grumbled in annoyance as something hard pressed into his neck. Still more than half asleep, he idly wondered what the offending object was. It didn't feel like anything that was likely to be in his bed. As he became more aware, he quickly noticed that a few things were not quite right with the whole situation.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjc5N2E1MzRiYzQ5ZmQ4NGE0ODkwYTI3ZDM5NjY5" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZTczNzU1M2I0ZDQ4MzRhNDdkN2IzZjkzMWZmMjJl" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Blinking open his eyes, he realized several things in short order. First, he wasn't in his bed. Second, he wasn't in his apartment. Third, he was dreaming, because there wasn't a forest anything like this anywhere near the city.</p>

Also, why am I not awake now, usually once I realize it is a dream I just wake up.</em></p>

<p class="cnM5YTJjNjU1YTk4OTRjYjc4NTg3YTJhY2EwN2RkZWVl" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Blearily, Rain examined his surroundings for anything of interest. The forest looked, well, it looked like a forest. Trees, rocks, grass, birds chirping, pretty standard stuff. No giant mushrooms or smoking caterpillars to prove the unreality of the situation.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTI3YWE5ZGE2ODQzNGViNWRmZDEwZGY3OTdjNmM3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYjcyM2FkMWVlZTRmMWJhNjBmODI4NTQwYmNhMTk5" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>Yup, I'm in a forest. Just go with it I guess. Hey, if I'm dreaming, does that mean I can control things?</em></p>

<p class="cnMzZWQxNDkwY2UwYjQ0OGZiNTZhNTljMGM1ZWIzOTUy" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Climbing to his feet and wincing at the crick in his neck, Rain looked around, then up. Raising his hands, he tried as hard as he could to will himself into the air.</p>

<p class="cnM4OWM3ZjI2ZmI0OTQzYWNhNWQwYTI5ZjcyNjIwNzNh" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">He was still standing where he started, holding his hands up to the sky in a superhero pose but looking more like an escapee from an asylum. His short brown hair was matted and sticking up in the back where his head had been lying against his oaken pillow. It was also a bit dirty and dusty, but thankfully free from twigs and leaves. He shivered as the breeze which had fooled him into thinking he had achieved takeoff cut through his pajamas. Looking down and sighing, he noticed a squirrel watching him from a stump. It chittered at his sudden movement.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDQwZmJlNWE3NjRiNTViZjg2MmI0OTY0ZTk4ZTQ4" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YWU4YzAxYTI4YjQ3YWU5NjJhNTVjZWRmYjI0NmI3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">“Yeah, yeah, keep laughing,” he said, glaring at the squirrel. The squirrel chittered again, then jumped across to a tree and climbed its way up and around the back of the trunk before re-emerging on top of a branch. Rain idly watched the squirrel and rubbed his arms as he tried to come to grips with his situation.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzNiODRmY2I1ZTQyY2ZiZmUwZmMyYTUyZjA1OTMw" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZWQwYTczOGM3NDRiNzhhZTdlMzRmODhmODM5NjU4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>OK, so not a dream. I'm cold, my neck hurts, the squirrel is mocking me, and I can't fly. Yeah, not my idea of a fun lucid dream. So, if I'm not dreaming, and I'm not in my house, then how the hell did I get here? I went to bed, fell asleep and then...someone broke into my apartment, drugged me, dragged me down three flights of stairs, shoved me into a car, drove hundreds of kilometers, dumped me in a forest, then peaced out? Yeah, don't think so. Though as pranks go, absolutely legendary.</em></p>

<p class="cnMyOWM4ZGQ1NWIyZjQxNjY4MWIxNzc3Mjg0ZGEyYzRj" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Obviously, the squirrel didn't answer. Rain shivered again; it wasn't that cold, but the air did have a definite chill. A white undershirt with a pair of plaid cotton pajama pants wasn't exactly the ideal outfit for traipsing around an old-growth forest.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWI2MGE0NTZjZDRjZDhiNDM4YWVhOGEyNTMyZTkz" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>

<p class="cnNlYmMwZWEyOTMxMDQzMGI5YzliMGExMDY4OGI1OWMz" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">“Summoned! To another world!” Rain shouted. The squirrel gave him a contemptuous look, then jumped to another tree to get away from the crazy person.</p>

<p class="cnNmY2UyYjY4NWNmODQxNjM4NDk0ZDg1ZDdkMGQxMWY1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Rain looked around. There wasn't much underbrush; there was nothing but trees and the odd rock in every direction. No sign of civilization, people, or a camera crew. Other than the quiet chirping of birds, there was no sound of traffic nor murmur of the city. There was no smog in the air nor glare of streetlights. There was only wild, untamed nature lit by the rays of the early morning sun.</p>

<p class="cnNjZDY4MmEwNzg1NzQzYzRiMDczYmQ3ZTI4YmQ1MGQw" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Rain sat down hard, leaning against the tree whose roots he had been using as a pillow. He sat there for several minutes, trying to work through the reality of his new situation. As his thoughts looped back on themselves, he started to get more and more concerned.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTdjMzdlY2I3ZjQyY2Q5NWZjZTU0ODQyYmIxOTc1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MmU2NWJjNGVjMTQ4NzU4Zjg5M2UzZmM2YzgyMGI1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">This wasn't a dream. He wasn't going to wake up. Regardless of how he had gotten there, he was alone, in the middle of a forest, in his pajamas. He sat under the tree, rubbing his arms against the chill as the sounds of the forest washed over him. After what seemed like hours, but in reality was only ten minutes, he climbed back to his feet.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDAzZjkxNTJhNDQ4NzM4YTQ3OGNmNjY2MDM5YmIy" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYmQ5OWFiMzI4NDRkZmZhMTMxYjU5ZWNlOTY2ZTdh" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>OK, panic later. Shelter, water, food, and in that order.</em></p>

<p class="cnNjZjY0NGZmOTY3ZDRlNjg4NGIyNDYwNWZmOTg1MzY0" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Having nothing to take with him, Rain looked around, picked a direction, and started walking. Looking at the sun, he decided on south and kept it to his left as he picked his way through the trees. Luckily, the ground was clear and loamy, so his lack of shoes was an annoyance and not any real impediment.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDMwZjA0MGQ4MjQwMjU5YzFiNGZiNTQyZTFjNWVh" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYjQ2Mjc1OWI5MzQ3NjE4YWU3MTM3MjgzZDUwNzFj" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Rain pondered his situation as he walked, scanning the forest for anything that looked like a sheltered cluster of trees, a cave, or maybe a motel. He continued like this for a few hours, stopping occasionally to lean against a tree and panic a bit. He would then move on only to stop and cower at the cry of some terrifying animal.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDA2ZDM0MDA2MDRlMmQ4NWRlNTU3YzJkYTA5MDA0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYWZjZTQ5ZWI1NjRmMjM4MjI3ZGVjMWQ3MDQwNjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">The cry had repeated several times. In the end, it turned out to have been a honey badger. Luckily, it didn't give a shit about him and let him pass. Rain was starting to get tired and a bit thirsty when he noticed that the trees were thinning out ahead. He picked up his pace and broke through onto a dirt road cutting through the forest.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTE5ZWFjMmU5NDQ2M2FhZTY4NDljZDY1YWNiMDUz" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMTIzYTE0YThlMTRkMmRhYTk2MDUwNTc1NTVmNWY3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">He sank to his knees and closed his eyes. Roads meant civilization. And civilization meant that a motel was looking a bit more likely than a cave after all.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTAzYjJjMjNhMDRmY2Q5M2I2YThiNDUwMDA1ZmI0" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNzVjZWRhODZiMTQwODBhNDEwNWNmN2FkZWI2OTA4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Rain rested for a few minutes before clambering back to his feet and looking down the road. He couldn't see anything in either direction. Shrugging, he turned left and started walking.</p>
<p class="cnNkNmQ3ZDI5YTkzYzQwZTA4OWUwNTEwMjI4MWEwYWNl" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MGEyOGMxMTM1NjQ1NTA4MzFkNWRkOGYwMzM1ZDRl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>Left is right! Onwards! </em><span style="font-style: normal">Rain thought to himself, trying to stay positive.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyMDRkZWM0OTk1OTRjOGE4NmU4YTBmNjMzYzMzMWRj" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">He hadn't been walking for more than fifteen minutes or so before he heard something in the distance. There was a curve in the road ahead, so he couldn't see the source, but he heard what sounded like a person whistling. Rain started jogging toward the sound, trying to ignore the pain in his feet from his long journey through the wilderness. As he got closer, he heard an angry shout, and the whistling cut off. That was followed by the sound of voices arguing with each other, but he couldn't make out the words, though he could hear them clearly.</p><div class="cjIxOTA1MTg5MzM1NDQ1ZWU4MDM5YjUwZGJkMjFmN2Yz">If you discover this narrative on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen.

<p class="cnM5YzUyMWE2OTUzZjQ4YjZhZWZlMWUyMzVlZjVkYjE1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">He stopped suddenly as a figure rounded the bend. The man was looking over his shoulder, shouting at someone, presumably the whistler. He was wearing a brown shirt and brown pants and looked a bit rough, but otherwise normal enough other than the bow and quiver of arrows. That was a bit odd.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzg1YzcxYzUxMjQ5ZWViZDUyNjA0ZDM4NmJkMDY2" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZTdlODlhZjdiMTQ0NmRhOTMzODUyM2VkNmNhNjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Rain stayed quiet, not wanting to surprise the man by hailing him. He waited for him to return his eyes to the road instead. When the man did turn back, he immediately spotted Rain and came to a sudden stop. He said something loudly to his companions, who followed quickly around the bend at his call.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTcyNzVkYTVhNDRiN2E4ZDEwNWE0MGQyNTU4MDA3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ODRmY2FkZjgxYjRmZGNiOTI0MjI1Y2QyNGY2YzA3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The man drew an arrow and nocked it, but didn't raise his bow. Stopping at least 20 meters from Rain, he raised his voice and asked something that sounded like a question. His three companions stood behind him, but Rain couldn’t take his eyes off the bow.</p>

<p class="cnM5NjgxMzZjZjI5MzQ3NmY5ZjAwZWY3ZjQ5Y2E2NTVi" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The man’s face furrowed in confusion. Looking at a red-haired man to his left, who Rain noted was wearing a brown bathrobe, he said something in the same unintelligible language. The other man simply shrugged.</p>

The last member of the party was a blonde woman with a large pack. Actually, large didn’t do it justice. This was an <em>absolute unit</em> of a pack. She wasn’t participating in the conversation, standing to one side and examining Rain with a strange expression on her face. The loud man seemed to reach some decision, barking an order to the archer and pushing him aside to stalk towards Rain.</p>

He repeated the same question the hook-nosed man had asked before, but Rain just shook his head and shrugged. He let his hands fall slightly but kept them where the man could see them. The man snorted, then shouted over his shoulder, not taking his eyes off Rain. The rest of the party approached, except the woman, who walked over to the side of the road and started taking off her pack. She grabbed an axe that was hanging from her belt and then started hacking at some of the nearby brush. It looked to Rain like she was clearing a space for something, but before he could wonder about that the man facing him barked an order at him. The man was pointing at the ground and watching Rain with an expectant look.</p>

It was clear now that the woman was setting up a campsite. She was piling bits of dead wood into what looked like the beginnings of a fire. The man with the bathrobe (<em>well, probably just a robe, it doesn't seem like any of the men had ever heard of a bath) </em>was gesturing at him and arguing with the man with the bow. The man with the sword ignored them both. He moved to the pack the woman had set down and started digging around in it. <em>How the hell was she carrying that huge thing?

<p class="cnM1NzU4M2JmMjhmYzQxYTM5NTI5NzBjNGNlZDc1ZDEx" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMGYwMDA1YTFlYjQ2Njc5ZWMyOTAxM2E1YzZmOTBi" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">He wasn't able to understand what they were saying, but he thought that the wiry man with the sword and the dark hair was the leader. His name was Hegar or something like that. Or, at least, maybe that was his name. It could have been a title like ‘boss’ or ‘chief’ for all Rain knew. He seemed to respond to it at any rate.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWU0ODY1ODM0OTQzZDA4NzhhYWJlZWYxZWVhMzRh" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYWJkZmZmZDA0YjRmMDQ4ODFmNmM4NzBjMDA4YWY2" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The lanky man with the robe gave Rain quite a shock as soon as the woman finished setting up the kindling for the fire. He suddenly barked a word, made a series of gestures, then pointed at the pile of dry sticks. As prepared as he was by a diet of hundreds of fantasy novels, TV shows, and movies, Rain was still surprised when a bolt of fire shot from the man's hands towards the pile. It hit with a blast of heat, causing the wood to burst into flames.</p>
<p class="cnNjMjBhZjc2OWNiMzQ5Y2FhNjkzZWZmYWY2ZjZmZDBl" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnMyODY2NjY1ZjVjMTRlNTI4MTFkZTdiM2RkMWYzZjc3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Luckily, Rain wasn't the only one to let out a manly exclamation of excitement. Hegar had been close to the fire at the time, and his deep bass bellow drowned out Rain's shriek as he batted at the hem of his pant-leg. Surprisingly, other than a long string of what Rain assumed to be expletives, there were no repercussions for the robed man. Rain decided he was going to call the man a mage, rather than a wizard. The robe was brown, after all, not blue with yellow stars. After that brief excitement, the red-haired mage had settled against a tree and promptly fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjM3ZmQyZjliYzQ2Yzk5ZDJmOTVmNGUwZWIyN2Qz" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNmY4MmU5YThjOTRhYjE4Y2RhMTE1ODQ5MjM3NWU1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The man with the bow had disappeared down the road almost immediately, hunting, apparently, as he came back with a pair of rabbits in short order. That was awfully fast to track and shoot the rabbits, so the man was either really good or really lucky. He had quickly cleaned them, then speared them on skewers over the fire. He had given the mage a kick as he returned to the camp, but the slumbering man just rolled over and ignored him.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWE4OTFmMmQyNTRlNmM4YmQ4OGEyYWI4NTk3Yjc2" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MThjMGY5YTQyMjRlZmViOGQyODgzMmZlYzc0NzVm" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The woman moved efficiently around the campsite, collecting wood and clearing a space for everyone to sit without getting covered in brambles. She barely spoke despite Hegar's constant nattering at her. Hegar kept pointing and gesturing, indicating where he wanted the fire, logs for sitting, the pack, and so forth. She was ignoring his requests for the most part, though she did help him move a log when it looked like he was going to hurt himself. The ease with which she lifted the huge tree trunk shocked Rain even more than the mage's trick with the fire.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODI5MjA3YmViODRjNGRiMTc1NjJjNjkxZGFjNjZk" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZGFlNWE2NDZmZTQ2ZTA4MzZiYzJjM2E3MzAwOTQ4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Rain found himself admiring her stoic resistance to Hegar's antics quite a bit. Despite the absurd strength, she seemed the most normal of the four. Granted, that wasn't hard when the competition was a lazy pyromaniac, a</span> micromanager<span style="font-style: normal">, and an archer entirely too fond of blood. Watching </span><span style="font-style: normal">the man</span><span style="font-style: normal"> skin the rabbits with a wicked grin on his face hadn't been pleasant. Not at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTZlZDkyYWYwNzRiNDdhZGQ2MGM5ZGQyNmM0MDFk" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMDdhM2ZiYTA5ZTRmZGI5NWJjNjU0NGFiYTNiMWUz" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Eventually, the rabbits were deemed sufficiently cooked and shared out to the four bandits. Funny how the mage woke up as soon as the archer pulled them off the fire.</p>
<p class="cnNhZGIzYzE3MTZjYjQ5MzdiZjJkNWE0MmJjNTQwNDkw" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MGJmMTg1Y2U2NDQ0OTI4MzJhYTgwNjMxMmExOWRh" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">“Hey!” Rain called out.</p>
<p class="cnMwN2I3NjYxYjg0ZDRkYTQ4YzliNmQwZDY5ZDEzYjRk" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNzdlYjA2ZTJhZDRiYzI4ODBkMjlmM2UwZDdiZjgw" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The three men ignored him, but the woman glanced in his direction, seeming to consider for a moment. She made to rip off another serving of meat, but Hegar stopped her with a shake of his head and a few words. The woman frowned, but nodded. She set her rabbit aside, grabbed a tin cup from her bag, filled it with water from a skin, and walked over to him. Rain sighed with relief as she held the cup up to his lips for him to drink.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2YzOWJmZTM5NDRkODE4YzMzMDBiZDU4OTE5ZGNl" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM3Mzg3ZjA3OWVmZjQ5ZjQ5YzZjNzJmYWI3YTg2NWU3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">“Ahhh, thank you,” he said, as she lowered the cup. She nodded, then brushed a strand of her blond hair away from her face and walked back over to the fire to resume her meal.</p>
<p class="cnNmM2NjMWNmYzRlZDQ2MjRiOTU3OWM2MDljNjI5NzRk" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDA4ZmU4NTM1YTQwODlhNWFjY2RkYTNiNTE4NDVi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>Hegar says no rabbit for the captive. Got it, he is a total ass. Not that I'm hungry after watching bow freak lick his knife like that. That isn't sanitary.</em></p>
<p class="cnM4MWNhZTI3N2YwZjQ1OTU4MTJiYzZhZmNmZjZmZWE0" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMjZjZWNiMzhjMTQzZDJhZTBkMjFiYjJkZjI1NjM1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Suddenly, all five of the people around the fire froze as a rustle came from the forest behind where Rain was sitting. Looking over his shoulder, Rain let out a yelp as he saw a pair of eyes staring at him. Scrambling away as best as he could with his hands bound, he watched in horror as a gigantic wolf prowled into the clearing. The thing was larger than any natural wolf had a right to be. It was gray, shaggy, and built like an angry refrigerator.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjBlYmEzNWQ2ZTQ1ZGE4OTMxNzJkMzNiZjZiN2Fh" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZmRlYWRmZTYxNjQ1MDg4ZWU0MzA2NzA3OGNhYWU2" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Hegar shouted loudly and leaped over the fire, drew his sword and placed himself in front of the monster. He sent several lightning-fast jabs at its snout, but the wolf-thing jumped back with supernatural speed. Hegar fell into a dueling stance, standing side-on to the creature, his sword extended with his offhand held above his head. The archer and mage scrambled to their feet to support their leader. The woman stood in the back calmly with no visible weapon, watching as the wolf growled and stalked back towards her companions.</p>
<p class="cnNkMGJkMTBmOWMzNDQxZDRiNmUxYzBhNjhmYmY0N2Y4" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZTFhNzUwNGQ3MzRkOTU4MjJhOGQ3MDg5MTBiYzBm" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The mage made a gesture and shouted. It was the same one he had used before. A bolt of fire shot towards the wolf. The flaming missile struck the wolf in the eye, and it roared and snapped in rage, ignoring Hegar's sword and rushing for the mage. The archer shot an arrow at its side where it stuck quivering, but it didn't seem to slow the wolf down at all. The mage shrieked and tripped, saved by chance as the wolf’s leaping lunge for his throat missed. The wolf landed next to the woman, who stepped back calmly. Rain was half expecting her to just suplex the damn thing, but it looked like she wasn't going to get involved in the fight.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTAzMjMwOWMxNzRmYmJhNjExYmI0NmUwNGMyOGEy" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDVlMGNhZmM2NzRmNzE5ZWVhYzE2NjkzZGExNzMy" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">The wolf howled in rage, clawing at its burning face. Hegar took advantage of its pain, leaping to stab it in the back and simultaneously getting in the way of a shot from the archer, who cursed and jerked his bow to the side at the last moment. Hegar shouted something and his blade blurred before sinking deep into the beast's back.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjZkNjdiZjQ0MjQ3ZmRhMjY4ZjVlY2JiNDkwYjk1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YmIzNTUyNGQzZTQ4NWNhNmU3YTM4ODA5NWVmNGI3" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>What was that? That wasn't just a normal thrust.</em></p>
<p class="cnM0YjE3OTA0ZGRjODQ0MDY4ZGM1MDhkNjlhYjU3NjU1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZDE5ZGI0NjEyMTRhNzI4MWZjNjgzM2RiM2U0OGIx" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Rain's stumbling mind had locked onto the glow that had surrounded the man's blade as it seemed to be drawn directly towards the beast's pelt. Rain laboriously pulled himself to his feet and stumbled away as the wolf howled in agony. An arrow took it in its un-burnt eye as it whirled to face its attacker, and, blinded, it opened its jaws to howl in rage. A second arrow followed the first, lodging itself in the back of its throat after passing through its wide open mouth. Like a puppet with its strings cut, the wolf collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2RkYmUzZDkwMDQ5MmY4MGE5NWI3NjU1ODBlZDkx" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNmI0NzFiZTQ4NzQ2NWZhZGI5NWZiNzY4OGRlNzFj" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal">Rain gasped, panting as the beast fell. He hadn't even had time to realize it was dead when, without warning, a brilliant blue box popped up in his vision.</p>

He had fallen to the ground when the wolf died and the message appeared. He had been feeling more and more like this world was some sort of game or copy of modern fantasy culture. Having it confirmed so blatantly was quite unexpected.</p>

It was making it a bit difficult to focus on the world with it hanging there. Also, it was shattering his assumptions about reality.</p>

The rope wasn't too tight, but it wasn't exactly pleasant. He swiped at the dialog with his bound hands. To his surprise, it moved with his touch, as if he was dismissing an app on his phone, sliding to the left and out of view. Even more interesting, the panel seemed like it had an actual physical form. It felt like glass, but somehow electric and fuzzy. Rain didn't know quite what to make of the feeling. At least he could see now.</p>

The mage also seemed like he had seen better days. He was sitting down with his eyes closed and was massaging his temples. Rain couldn't see the woman or the archer, but he assumed they were nearby. Nobody seemed to be paying attention to him.</p>

Hegar glanced up but didn't do anything to stop him. Instead, he moved towards the wolf. Drawing a knife from his belt, he started butchering the animal. Rain’s stomach flopped around unpleasantly and he decided to find something to distract himself.</p>

His character had died of poison as the rest of the party tried desperately to save him. It had been a bad time for Rain. His father had died at the start of the semester and he had decided to drop out to help support his mother. He had stuck around for this last session of the campaign, only for his character to fall in the final battle. The next day, he packed up his car and returned home, finding a job in construction. He hadn't kept in touch with James or any of his other friends. His mother had died a few years later and long hours and mild depression had caused him to withdraw from most human contact. It was only in the past few weeks or so that he had decided to claw himself out of the hole he had dug.</p>

He rubbed his eyes, wincing at the start of a headache. It had been an insane day of disorientation, walking, terror, more walking, and now overwhelming questions about the nature of reality. Worst of all, he hadn't had a coffee in something like half a day and the caffeine withdrawal was starting to kick in.</p>

<p class="cnNkYzIwMTg0Yzk4NTQxNDliZGVjMGI5ZDI3N2UxZjA4" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Looking over at Hegar, he saw that he had managed to remove the wolf's pelt. He was currently arguing with the archer, who had returned at some point. The object of the argument seemed to be a huge, ragged slab of meat Hegar was holding in his hand while he gestured at the fire. Apparently, Hegar thought musk wolf made for good eating, but the archer disagreed. Mid-sentence, the archer cut off and tilted his head, then looked out to the road, narrowing his eyes. Rain followed his gaze and started searching the treeline across the road for whatever had caught his attention.</p>

While he was distracted, Hegar had managed to impale the slab of meat on a skewer and propped it over the fire. He grinned at the archer, hands on his hips proudly, despite being covered in the wolf's blood. The bucket of water that the woman dumped over his head took him completely by surprise. He hollered as the archer bent over, laughing and gasping for air. The woman just smiled and threw a cloth at Hegar, who decided to be a good sport and sighed, rubbing at his clothes with the rag. It looked more like he was spreading out the bloody stains, not actually removing them. Suddenly, Rain heard something that could only be described as a <em>splortch</em>. He jumped and snapped his gaze back to the road. Something had wandered out of the trees and was squelching its way towards them.</p>

The archer didn't even glance over at it; instead, he was trying to start a conversation with the woman, who was resolutely ignoring him. The mage was nowhere to be seen.</p>

Hegar glanced at him, then poked the archer, who whirled around and demanded something in an annoyed tone. Hegar pointed at the slime. The archer snorted and wandered away. The woman shook her head.</p>

Rain started to back away, but tripped over something, falling hard to the ground. Hegar snorted, and with a flick of his sword cut the rope binding Rain's hands. Rain gulped.</p>

Hoisting him to his feet, he gave him a push towards the slime, which Rain now saw was actually more interested in the bloody ground near the wolf's remains than the humans in the camp.</p>

Looking around, he spotted a sturdy branch over at the side of the clearing. Hegar watched him patiently. Picking up the branch, he gave it a few swings.</p>

The slime was about the size of a large dog but had no other defining features. It was starting to take on a somewhat red tinge as it fed on the blood of the wolf. Somehow, it seemed to detect Rain's approach, as it quivered, then leaped at him. Screaming, Rain swung his branch like a bat and felt it make contact with the putrid mass. Instead of flying off into the outfield, the section of the blob that he hit splattered everywhere, some of it landing in Rain's mouth.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjBiNzJlNDJkNjQzNzM5OWVhMTZlMzQwZDY3ZDJk" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"> </p>

His hit had killed the slime's momentum and it looked like it had done some damage, but it wasn't without cost. It felt like someone had dumped a bin of used diapers over him. Clumps of disgusting sludge were dripping down his face and plopping onto the ground. As he coughed and spluttered, the sound of raucous laughter reached his ears. He made out three distinct male voices gasping and wheezing in merriment.</p>

The slime had drawn back and was sloshing side to side. It recovered and started moving towards him again. Rain walked backward, staying out of the range that it was able to leap. The slime continued to follow sedately as Rain walked toward the fire.</p>

The slime lit up immediately and then started bubbling. Rain heard a curse from behind him, but before he could do anything the slime exploded, sending chunks of burning goo flying all over the camp. He dove backward, then rolled over, trying to smother the drops of burning sludge that had landed on him before. He writhed in the dirt, trying to bat out the chunky lumps of goo and having moderate success. He was aided by the fact that the goo burned quickly, almost too quickly to set his clothing on fire. Soon, all that was left was the odd clump that had somehow escaped the blaze, as well as a smell that defied description.</p>

He was shocked to see that three of the figures were protected by a bluish magic field which dropped as he watched, revealing them to be unharmed. Brovose lowered his hands and laughed, not looking at Rain but instead at Hegar, who Rain saw was in just as bad of a state as himself. He wasn't on fire but his face was beet red and he was screaming at Brovose as he gagged and spluttered.</p>

<p class="cnMxOTg4MjFhNjJiZTRkNWI4MGQ5MjBmYTczNmE2MWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: normal" align="left"><em>Level 1 slime. Not a Dire Dumpster Slime or a Putrid Pustule or anything. Just a regular old slime.</em><span style="font-style: normal"> Rain thought, dismissing the dialog, then clawing futilely at the oily, lumpy mess covering him. </span><em>I will never be clean again.</em></p>
<p class="cnMwYTI3NzUyODIxNjRmMzU4MjdmZGI4OTMwNDQzMDE3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDczYTYzODRhYzQ4YTU4YzE1Mjk0YzBhNmMwMzA2" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">No sooner than he thought this, the slime started to dry out and flake off, dissolving into motes of dust even before it hit the ground. The smell also started to fade as the mess in the camp dissolved into thin air. There was a faint white glow in the air, pulsing in intensity. Looking for the origin, he noticed that the woman had her eyes closed and arms spread. The glow was emanating from her body and washing away the filth as if it had never been. The pulses of light built on her skin before silently breaking away, diffusing outwards in a sphere. The light drifted through the clearing like a pale, luminous fog, curling around objects it encountered and rolling along the ground in eddying waves. It faded away after having traveled several meters beyond the edge of the camp.</p>
<p class="cnMwM2I4ZDgzMGEwNTRjMGI4ZWE3NjI2MjljMDI0ZTE5" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMzExNWI4YjU3ODRmYzg5MWJkMjcyYzZmNmZmYzRk" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">Motion caught his eye and he watched Brovose walk over to ground zero and bend to pick something up. A white glint escaped his hand as he palmed up the tiny object before tucking it into a pouch at his belt. Rain wondered what the object was as Hegar joined him in standing next to the woman. Hegar tapped his foot impatiently as the light did its work.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmI1YTFjYmU2OTQ1NGFhMmZmNzM4MTgyOTNhMjQ1" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzA0NjkzNDc1ZDQ3M2I4NjlkOGNmN2I2MWE4NTM2" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">It took about 30 seconds, but when she finally stopped, Rain felt as if he had just taken a shower. At least on the outside. The memory was still all too real for him to feel truly clean. Looking down, he saw that his clothes, while singed, looked neat and freshly laundered.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWY5NDk3YmExODQ5YzhhOWU5OTA5ZjRkMWM4YzBh" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZWQ5ZWU4YzljZDRiMmQ5MTRkZGZhOTg1YjMyMGVi" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">The camp was silent, save for the anguished moan of Hegar as he realized that his wolf steak had fallen into the fire in the excitement and was now charred beyond all saving. The wolf corpse itself was gone, bones and all, but somehow the pelt remained. It looked like it had been freshly dry-cleaned, if a bit matted down and tangled.</p>

<p class="cnNmNGMzNjQwODI1NzRhOWZhYWQ0ZWRiMTJlZDhhZmIx" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: normal" align="left"><em>Well. That happened.</em></p>

<p class="cnNjMDllMzM1MWFmNTQ5MTRiYWJmNTJhYjFiZjlmYzRh" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">Rain looked at the woman in awe as she calmly walked over to her pack. Shouldering it, she started collecting her various supplies and tucking them away. The others were lazing about.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDFiYzY4NTNkYzRhZThiMTQ5OWIzMzBmMGYxYWY5" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left"> </p>

<p class="cnMxZDAwNWVmOGE2MTQyMDlhODZiNmU0MGRiNWNmNTQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">Rain got up and moved to do just that. Accepting the crooked spoon he handed her, she nodded to him in thanks. She glanced at where the slime had been, then at the branch, which had been blown into the middle of the road, then back at Rain. Before returning to the cleanup, she smiled and shook her head with a chuckle of amusement.</p>
<p class="cnNjNmY4MmJiZjc2ZjQ3ZWZhNTUxOWI3NDg0Njg4YmNk" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZjBjMjM0ZWM1YTQ3MjM4NTRjYmU1YTE1YjlhZmMw" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">“Hey,” Rain said, as they worked. She looked at him, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzI2ODYyODBlZDQ0ZDJhMDhhYjA5YWQzNjRhMjg3" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OGVjY2IzMGE1NTQyZWE4MDIyYWUxNGUxNDQ1ZmRl" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">“Thank you.” He knew she didn't understand him, but he felt he needed to say it anyway. He wasn't exactly sure what her role was in this little group, but she was clearly the only responsible member of the party.</p>

<p class="cnM3MWZmN2Y0YmNiMDQzMTc4NWM0NGI4MWIxZDBjYzkz" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">She just shook her head. Then, she gestured to herself and said a word.</p>

<p class="cnNjMGRkZjVmNjVjMTQyMzViOGNiODc3OWU5MTY3YzBj" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">“Ameliah.” She then pointed to the others and named them in turn.</p>

<p class="cnNmYzc1ODQ1ZTFiMzRmMDE4ZTA1NmJkMjQ0MDQ4ZTcz" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">“Anton,” she indicated the archer, “Brovose,” the mage, and with a roll of her eyes the swordsman, “Hegar.”</p>

<p class="cnMwZjI0ZmZkY2Y4NzRhNzJhYWJlNjhhMDNkYTExYjIy" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">She ended by gesturing at Rain, opening her palm in an inviting gesture.</p>

<p class="cnM3MmEyMzIxZTczYjRmOTRhZmRiM2ZmN2ZjOTU3OWUx" style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal" align="left">“Rain,” he replied, touching his chest.</p>
